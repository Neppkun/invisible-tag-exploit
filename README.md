# Invisible Tag Exploit

## Introduction

I saw someone make this but it was shitty. So I made it better.

It sends messages to a Discord channel of your choosing that has an invisible text inside. It can be a secret message or you can use it to ping people without the "@someone" thing showing on the message itself.

# How to use it?

You install Python

You install this code

You double click on this code

You do what it says

Couldn't be easier

( Forgot to mention: You'll need to put it like `<@(user ID)>` for the ping to work )
